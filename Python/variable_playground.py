# Python does not seem to have an variable type declaration like C 
# Simple and pratical if I am going to be honest ;3

x = 0
name = "Pedro"
print(x)
print(name)

y = 5
z = 9999
# Calculation between numbers using vars
print(y + z)
print(y * x) # Lmao XD obviously.... it's 0 at the end of the day. 
print(z / y)

person_name_1 = "Sarah"
person_name_2 = "Ana"
# Using multiple vars in a single print.
print(person_name_1, "talked with", person_name_2)

# But... we can speficy the variable type.

k = int(5)
l = float(5.12)
lable_txt = str(920.10)

print(k * l)
print(k / l)
print(lable_txt)
